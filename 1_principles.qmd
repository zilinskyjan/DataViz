## There are always tradeoffs

The central tradeoff often is **trutfulness** vs.

-   Readability vs. "completeness"
-   Concise vs. "attention-gabbing"
-   Simplicity vs. other goals

If you drop outliers, for example, your chart's readability will almost surely improve, but it could be less truthful.
