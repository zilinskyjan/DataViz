    "text": "Telling stories with R: Data Visualization\nInstructor: Jan Zilinsky\nCreating effective visualizations of social and political data can help you discover and communicate new insights. This is a course designed to help students become better communicators with R. The focus is on graphing various types of evidence including:\n\n\n- summaries of statistical models\n- quantitative representations of text (e.g. content of social media post and the accompanying metadata)\n- macro-economic data\n\nStudents are encouraged to think creatively about visualizing different types of information and data. Significant coding experience with R is expected, but prior knowledge of issues related to design, style, and principles of data visualization is not required. \n\nAfter taking this course, students will be expected to be able to present real data clearly and to identify strengths and weakness of existing data displays and dashboards.\nAssignments:\n\nCreate your own dataset (30%).\n\nCreate your own dataset. It needs to have at least one of these 3 attributes\n\nMultiple levels (at least 2).\nOriginal topic, subject or angle.\nImpressive scope (e.g. time dimension)\n\nEasy example of #1: rating things you like.\n\nSuppose you decide go the “quantified self” route and create a dataset with evaluations the favorite TV shows of the members of your group.\nWhat’s the outcome variable? (Multiple attributes can be assessed.)\nWhat levels can be measured?\n\nIf you are rating a TV show, the natural components would be seasons, and episodes. Within episodes there might be themes or actors. Unpacking these attributes opens possibilities for creating stories, making interactive visualizations, etc.\n\n\n\nFinal project (70%)\n\nForm a group of 3 (max. 4) classmates\nStart thinking about topic after lecture 3\nPrepare a compelling data visualization\nSome elements in R are expected, you could also use D3 or another language if you wish.\n\n\n\nExpectations\n- Please use your devices only to take notes\n- No multitasking\n- You are already fluent in R and R Studio\n- Get the most recent version of R; Install R Studio; install the tidyverse library"
