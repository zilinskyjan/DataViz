# Overview of this class {.unnumbered}

Creating effective visualizations of social and political data can help you discover and communicate new insights. This is a course designed to help students become better communicators with R. The focus is on graphing various types of evidence including:

```         
- public opinion data
- macro-economic data
- summaries of statistical models
- quantitative representations of text (e.g. content of social media post and the accompanying metadata)

Students are encouraged to think creatively about visualizing different types of information and data. Significant coding experience with R is expected, but prior knowledge of issues related to design, style, and principles of data visualization is not required. 
```

After taking this course, students will be expected to be able to present real data clearly and to identify strengths and weakness of existing data displays and dashboards.

### Introductory topics

-   What works and what to avoid even if it works?
-   Principles of visual perception and effect communication
-   Getting familiar with ggplot

### A ggplot deep dive

```         
- Toplines, cross-tabs
- Geometries, statistics and coordinates
- Facets, themes
- Refining plots
- 3-way cross-tabs
- Heatmaps
```

### Visualizing output from statistical models

```         
- Coefficients and uncertainty
- Predicted probabilities, marginal effects, and interactions
- Model performance (in-sample and out-of-sample comparisons) 
- Machine learning output (regression trees, most important variables, etc.)
```

**Assignments:**

-   Create your own dataset (30%).
    -   Create your own dataset. It needs to have at least one of these 3 attributes
        1.  Multiple levels (at least 2).
        2.  Original topic, subject or angle.
        3.  Impressive scope
-   Final project (70%)
    -   Form a group of 2-3 students
    -   Prepare a compelling data visualization
    -   Some elements in R are expected, you could also use [D3](https://github.com/scotthmurray/d3-book) or another language if you wish.
