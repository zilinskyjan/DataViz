    "text": "Overview of this class\nCreating effective visualizations of social and political data can help you discover and communicate new insights. This is a course designed to help students become better communicators with R. The focus is on graphing various types of evidence including:\n- public opinion data\n- macro-economic data\n- summaries of statistical models\n- quantitative representations of text (e.g. content of social media post and the accompanying metadata)\n\nStudents are encouraged to think creatively about visualizing different types of information and data. Significant coding experience with R is expected, but prior knowledge of issues related to design, style, and principles of data visualization is not required. \nAfter taking this course, students will be expected to be able to present real data clearly and to identify strengths and weakness of existing data displays and dashboards.\n\nIntroductory topics\n\nWhat works and what to avoid even if it works?\nPrinciples of visual perception and effect communication\nGetting familiar with ggplot\n\n\n\nA ggplot deep dive\n- Toplines, cross-tabs\n- Geometries, statistics and coordinates\n- Facets, themes\n- Refining plots\n- 3-way cross-tabs\n- Heatmaps\n\n\nVisualizing output from statistical models\n- Coefficients and uncertainty\n- Predicted probabilities, marginal effects, and interactions\n- Model performance (in-sample and out-of-sample comparisons) \n- Machine learning output (regression trees, most important variables, etc.)\nAssignments:\n\nCreate your own dataset (30%).\n\nCreate your own dataset. It needs to have at least one of these 3 attributes\n\nMultiple levels (at least 2).\nOriginal topic, subject or angle.\nImpressive scope\n\n\nFinal project (70%)\n\nForm a group of 2-3 students\nPrepare a compelling data visualization\nSome elements in R are expected, you could also use D3 or another language if you wish."
